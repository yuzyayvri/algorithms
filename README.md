# Yuzy's Algorithms Collection
A collection of my algorithm implementations for learning and reference. Learned and written personally. This is sort of a journey showcasing my improvement in Python.
Also— these algorithms are libraries and are reusable.

Note: There is more information about the algorithms in their docstrings, so check that out if you want to learn more. This documentation only provides a brief and very oversimplified rundown!
## Implemented Algorithms

### Sorting
- **Bubble Sort** - An extremely basic algorithm. Sorts by comparing adjacent elements— though I personally don't recommend this.
- **Selection Sort** - A very simple sorting algorithm. Sorts by finding the minimum element and swaps it with the current one.

### Searching
- **Linear Search** - A really, really simple searching algorithm. Sorts by looping through an array and checking if the element matches the target.
- **Binary Search** - An efficient and easy searching algorithm. Sorts by cutting the search space in the array in half until it finds the target.

## Usage
Look in the algorithm files and read the docstrings for more information.
